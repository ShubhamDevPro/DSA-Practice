## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of DSA questions solved using Java. The main goal is to create a resource that others can use to practice and learn. Each problem is organized into its own directory, containing the Java source file along with a README providing a brief description of the problem and its solution approach.


Feel free to explore each problem directory for the Java source code.

## How to Use
